						</div>
						<p class="mt-3">Phishing is among the most productive and successful means for attackers to exploit victims. 
							Phishing is when a hacker fishes for your private information. 
							URL Phishing is a social engineering attack used to steal usersâ€™ information such as username, 
							password, and credit card number.Upon opening the message, 
							 the recipient is duped into clicking a malware link that can lead to hacking their system with a ransomware attack, 
							 installation of a virus, or revealing personal and financial information such as credit card information. 
							 URL phishing attacks are successful only when the person opens the malicious link to a website and gives away sensitive information. 
							 Usually, perpetrators masquerade those malicious URLs as identity confirmation or password resets. Hackers can even replicate the entire
							  site to create a phishing website, so that the victim thinks it is a legitimate website. These fake websites are so similar to the real
							   ones that users may not detect any difference. URL phishing attacks are advancing with an increasing success rate and becoming progressively 
							   more difficult to identify.</p>
